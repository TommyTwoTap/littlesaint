  AND OPERATING AUTHORITY</h1>
<p align="center" class="style13"><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/reader"></a></p>
<p align="justify" class="style6">The Little St. Germain Lake Protection and Rehabilitation District was created on January 15, 1980 by order of the Vilas County Board of Supervisors upon being petitioned by the Little St. Germain Lake Association. The county board found that all requirements of Chapter 33 of the Wisconsin Statutes had been satisfied.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style6">The actual resolution adopted by the county board was prepared prior to modern electronic documentation. A copy of the type written resolution has been  scanned and saved on this website in pdf format. The two page document can be seen be clicking on the following links: <a href="misc_documents/resolution_of_creation_pg1.pdf">Page 1</a> <a href="misc_documents/resolution_of_creation_pg2.pdf">Page 2 </a></p>
<p align="justify" class="style6">The district is defined by geographic boundaries. All properties within those boundaries, except those specifically referenced in the legal description of the district, constitute the make-up of the district and are subject to tax levies authorized by the majority of eligible voters in attendance at annual meetings of the district. A larger  pdf version of the following district boundaries map can be accessed by clicking <a href="misc_documents/district_boundary_maps_w_fonts.pdf">HERE.</a></p>
<p align="center" class="style18"><img src="images/district_map_low_res.jpg.jpg" alt="district map" width="635" height="489" /></p>
<p align="justify" class="style6">The legal description of the territory within the district boundaries was revised by the Board of Commissioners in late 2009. Vilas County tax records were amended accordingly to ensure that 2009 property tax bills (payable in 2010) were prepared in accordance with the revised description. Although the boundaries of the district were not amended, the description of the boundaries was updated to more accurately reflect the boundary lines.  In addition, off-water properties within the district boundaries, but not having deeded access to the lake, were declared exempt from the district.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style6">The current legal description of the Little St. Germain Lake District is as follows:  </p>

<p align="justify" class="style6">Lake districts are authorized  by Chapter 33 of the Wisconsin Statutes. As a form of governmental entity with tax levying powers, lake districts are subject to the same open meetings, open records and ethics laws as any other form of government. Lake districts do not function with bylaws, but under the stipulations of Chapter 33 of the Wisconsin Statutes. </p>
